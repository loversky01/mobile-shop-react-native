Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F. Let chicken drain on a few paper towels when it comes out of the fryer. Serve hot.'

      '-- Place a rack in upper third of oven. Place a large cast-iron skillet on rack and preheat oven to 500° (or as high as your oven will go). Place pizza dough in a large bowl, pour a little oil over, and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic and let dough proof at room temperature while pan and oven heat up.\n\n -- Meanwhile, cook hot sauce, marinara sauce, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Stir in cream, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and warmed through, about 10 minutes. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chicken, toss to coat, then add ¼ cup Buffalo sauce.\n\n -- Cook chicken, tossing occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until chicken is well coated and sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk yogurt, lemon juice, celery salt, garlic powder, ¼ cup blue cheese, ½ tsp. pepper, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl, adding more water if sauce seems too thick (it should be pourable); set aside.\n\n -- Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape with your hands into a round that’s slightly larger than the cast-iron skillet you’re using. Take hot skillet out of oven (watch that handle!) and place on a heatproof surface. Add a little flour to pan. Lay dough in skillet, then work edges of dough up sides of skillet with your fingertips (use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon if you’re nervous about touching the hot pan). Drizzle a little oil around inside edge of pan so that it trickles behind and underneath dough, which will encourage browning and help it release.\n\n -- Spread about ⅓ cup Buffalo sauce over dough. Arrange mozzarella over, then top with remaining ¼ cup blue cheese. Arrange chicken mixture on top. Bake pizza on top rack until crust and cheese are nicely browned, 15–20 minutes. Transfer skillet to stovetop (again, watch that handle!) and let pizza rest a few minutes. Using a spatula, slide pizza onto a cutting board or platter. Arrange celery over, then top with reserved blue cheese dressing. Season with pepper, then drizzle with oil.'

Now - either refrigerate until ready to finish cooking, or cool completely and freeze up to 3 months. To freeze properly - place completely cooled fries in single layer on tray and place in freezer until frozen. Then bag them.\n\n -- To finish cooking - preheat your oil to 400* F. Add your cold fries (which will drop the oil temp - which is fine because you want it near the 375 degrees F. temp) and cook a few minutes until done. Lightly salt them and shake well so that the salt distributes well and they are not salty.'

Cut any hard skin off the pancetta and set aside, then chop the meat. Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente.\n\n -- Meanwhile, rub the pancetta skin, if you have any, all over the base of a medium frying pan (this will add fantastic flavour, or use 1 tablespoon of oil instead), then place over a medium-high heat. Peel the garlic, then crush with the palm of your hand, add it to the pan and leave it to flavour the fat for 1 minute. Stir in the pancetta, then cook for 4 minutes, or until it starts to crisp up. Pick out and discard the garlic from the pan, then, reserving some of the cooking water, drain and add the spaghetti.\n\n -- Toss well over the heat so it really soaks up all that lovely flavour, then remove the pan from the heat. Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, season with pepper, then pour in the egg mixture – the pan will help to cook the egg gently, rather than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking water until it’s lovely and glossy. Serve with a grating of Parmesan and an extra twist of pepper.'
